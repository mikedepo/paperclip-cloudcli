# Changelog

Each entry is an update Railway offers to existing deployments of the template. Updates are opt-in: nothing changes until you apply one, and your data is kept (see the README).

## 2026-11-02 (2)

- Each service's start log links to this changelog, after the line with its commit.

## 2026-11-02

- First release from this repository. The template's Paperclip and CloudCLI services now build from it (before, the same scripts were packed into each service's start command), so later changes reach existing deployments as Railway update notices.
- Each service logs the commit it runs at start: `[paperclip-cloudcli] Paperclip service, code <commit>`.
